                <h2>Good Vibes Summarized</h2>
                <p>
                    Good Vibes is an Amazon Alexa skill that aims to assist users with depression.
                    <br />Although Alexa may not be physically present, her interactions will be conversational
                    <br />in the form of a voice user interface.
                </p>

                <h2> Why did we create Good Vibes?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to TechCrunch, 16 percent of Americans own a smartspeaker.(1) More specifically,
                    <br />GeekWire states that there are more than 8 million people that own an Alexa Device.(2) Healthline
                    <br />stated in an article that there is a recorded amount of 16 million cases of people that experienced
                    <br />at least one major depressive episode in 2012.(3)<br />

                    <br />Depression takes on many forms and is often difficult to diagnose. It can be common that somebody
                    <br />in a current state of depression does not have the desire to seek help, let alone leave their house.
                    <br />This, is where our application has the benefit of easy in-home access for anybody with an Echo device.<br />

                    <br />This web page will show you how to contribute to the development of the Good Vibes Alexa skill.

            <h2>Assessment Tests</h2>
            <p>
                Taking assessment tests will allow the skill to have a better understanding of the user’s state of
                <br />depression. This will in turn allow the skill to respond with articles and more personalized responses
                <br />to try to help the user.
            </p>

            <h2>Express Feelings</h2>
            <p>
                Users will be able to talk about how they are feeling to Good Vibes and the skill will try to provide useful
                <br />responses. If the user states that they are having a nice day, then Good Vibes may respond with positive reinforcement
                <br />such as “Great moves, keep it up, proud of you”. If the user states that they are feeling upset, then Good Vibes might
                <br />give the user a suggestion such as “ You deserve some relaxation. How about watching a movie to take your mind off of things?”
                <br />or Good Vibes might try to give other forms of support like, “I am here for you and I am not going anywhere.”
            </p>

            <h2>Trigger Words</h2>
            <p>
                Since depression is a serious topic that cannot be taken lightly, we have to consider some extreme cases. This might include
                <br />suicidal or self-harmful thoughts, that Good Vibes will try to hear out. If an event like this were to occur, Good Vibes will
                <br />suggest seeking out help while also reassuring that the user still has a purpose in life. Good Vibes will also provide the number
                <br />for the suicide hotline.

                <strong>Q: Why did the team at Good vibes choose node.js instead of other languages such as Python or Java?</strong>
                <br /><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A: </strong> The team at Good Vibes chose to develop with node.js because of the Alexa SDK that enables developers to focus on creating engaging features rather than writing hundreds of lines of code. Other languages are great for different purposes, such as Python with machine learning, but node.js provides the easiest way for developers to create Alexa skills.
                <br />

                <br /><strong>Q: What languages do I need to know to develop a skill like Good Vibes?</strong>
                <br /><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A: </strong>Alexa skills can be written in almost any programming language. You can simply choose the language that best fits your skill set and knowledge; however, the team at Good Vibes recommends starting off with node.js because of the Alexa Skill Development Kit and other tools that can accessed through node.js.
                <br />
                <br /><strong>Q: Do I need experience with programming to get started developing Alexa Skills?</strong>
                <br /><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A: </strong> No you do not need to be an expert at programming to develop skills. When you are creating a skill, you can select an option to start with a blueprint that contains the code needed in the AWS lambda function. You can always edit the code in a blueprint or start from scratch if you have prior knowledge of programming.
                <br />
                <br /><strong>Q: Why should I choose Good Vibes instead of using traditional measures to aid depression?</strong>
                <br /><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A: </strong> Good Vibes provides a human-like interaction that is both free and convenient for users. Alexa is a great alternative for those that do not want to talk to anyone about their depression. Users will not have to live with the fear of judgment using Good Vibes since Alexa is here with the sole purpose of providing assistance.
