# Good Vibes

>## Executive Summary

Millions of people throughout the United States experience mental health issues. Among those is issues is depression which can lead to 
suicide and other harsh circumstances. Suicide is often overlooked as one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The suicide
rate may be incredibly high due to the lack of clinically depressed patients seeking treatment for their illness. 

There is a limited amount of screening tools and intervention techniques that assist patients undergoing depression. A lack of
accessibility for these ailments ultimately contributes to the disproportionate amount of those seeking the proper treatment for their
mental health.

 More techniques and technologies can be utilized to alleviate a patient's depression symptoms. An Alexa anti-depression application will
 be developed to assist the users that experience depression. Through the use of the application, a patient suffering from depression can
 receive recommendations and assistance based on dialogue and discussions. The user will take an assessment test upon installation in
 order for the application to properly assess the user levels of depression. 

A successful anti-depression application with Alexa can mitigate the  symptoms of depression experienced among its users. Although Alexa
may not be physically present, her interactions will diminish the feelings of loneliness and helplessness. The application may even be
able to lower suicide rates and improve the overall quality of life.
