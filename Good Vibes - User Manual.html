                <h2>Good Vibes Summarized</h2>
                <p>
                    Good Vibes is an Amazon Alexa skill that aims to assist users with depression.
                    <br />Although Alexa may not be physically present, her interactions will be conversational
                    <br />in the form of a voice user interface.
                </p>

                <h2>Why did we create Good Vibes?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to TechCrunch, 16 percent of Americans own a smartspeaker.(1) More specifically,
                    <br />GeekWire states that there are more than 8 million people that own an Alexa Device.(2) Healthline
                    <br />stated in an article that there is a recorded amount of 16 million cases of people that experienced
                    <br />at least one major depressive episode in 2012.(3)<br />

                    <br />Depression takes on many forms and is often difficult to diagnose. It can be common that somebody
                    <br />in a current state of depression does not have the desire to seek help, let alone leave their house.
                    <br />This, is where our application has the benefit of easy in-home access for anybody with an Echo device.<br />

                    <br />This web page will show you how to use the Good Vibes Alexa skill.

            <h2>Assessment Tests</h2>
            <p>
                The assessment test is based off of the Patient Health Questionaire (PHQ-9) which will determine the severity
                <br />of depression. Test scores are saved for future reference to validate any progress in helping with
                <br />depression. Tests can be taken an unlimited amount of times, where the most recent test score will
                <br />overwrite any previous test scores on the account.
            </p>

            <h2>Discussions</h2>
            <p>
                Users will be able to talk about how they are feeling to Good Vibes and the skill will try to provide useful
                <br />responses. If the user states that they are having a nice day, then Good Vibes may respond with positive reinforcement
                <br />such as “Great moves, keep it up, proud of you”. If the user states that they are feeling upset, then Good Vibes might
                <br />give the user a suggestion such as “ You deserve some relaxation. How about watching a movie to take your mind off of things?”
                <br />or Good Vibes might try to give other forms of support like, “I am here for you and I am not going anywhere.”
            </p>
